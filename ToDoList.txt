Stuff To Do

1. Make a 1v1 battle simulator
2. Let the user view top 10s, 20s, 50s, etc. (highest damage moves, highest stat pokemon, etc.)
3. Let the user view pokemon of certain types
4. Check if inputted moves are valid for certain pokemon (Pikachu shouldn't be able to be assigned moves it can't learn).
    Maybe? The rule may not be true for gym leaders (check the games).
